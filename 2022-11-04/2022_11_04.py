## Calculate the number of steps in a algorithm to find the number of steps in a algorithm

# Simple index for loop

for i in range(10):
    print(i)

## The algorithm takes 10 steps to complete in that case

## f(n) = 10

## Keep track of the sum of all the numbers you are printing

count = 0
for i in range (10):
    print(i)
    count += i
print(count)

# This way we add the number found in the loop to the count variable

## The algorithm takes 11 steps to complete in that case
